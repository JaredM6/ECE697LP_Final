# ECE697LP_Final

m_motion.c - Added the color selector near the bottom around line 650. Added a linkage to m_ui.h to the top, as it uses the led function from m_ui.c

m_ui.c - In order for the color to change, the m_ui_led_constant_set() function was added to the end. This is from tutorial 0. 

m_ui.h - Need to also declare the function in the corresponding header file.
